# MEDIA WATCHER
This is a web application for stream video from a serveur. It's main use is for my local home serveur where i store everything including media. So i don't have to share the whole media folder in the network.
It's written in C# with ASP.Net Web MVC.

## KNOWN ISSUES
- Pages aren't responsive. It works well on 1920x1080 windows
- For now only support mp4 video due to using html built-in video player component
